# Yoga Sequence Generation Guidelines

## General Sequencing Principles

1. **Warm-up to Cool-down Flow**: Always structure sequences from warm-up to peak to cool-down
2. **Balance**: Include counter-poses after intense poses (e.g., backbend followed by forward fold)
3. **Progressive Intensity**: Gradually increase intensity, reach a peak, then gradually decrease
4. **Breath Awareness**: Include breath cues appropriate to the style (e.g., Ujjayi for vinyasa)
5. **Transition Awareness**: Create smooth, logical transitions between poses

## Duration-Based Sequencing

- **15 minutes**: 5-8 poses with minimal holds
- **30 minutes**: 12-15 poses with moderate holds
- **45 minutes**: 18-20 poses with a clear peak
- **60 minutes**: 20-25 poses with multiple intensity peaks
- **75-90 minutes**: 25-35 poses with complex sequences and longer holds

## Style-Specific Guidelines

### Vinyasa
- Breath-synchronized movement
- Sun salutations as foundational sequences
- Dynamic transitions
- Shorter holds (3-5 breaths)
- Flow between standing poses

### Hatha
- Longer holds (5-10 breaths)
- More static poses
- Focus on alignment
- Often includes pranayama
- More verbal instruction needed

### Yin

- Focus on connective tissue
- Minimal muscular engagement
- Seated and supine poses predominate

### Restorative
- Extended holds (5-10 minutes)

# Vinyasa Flow Guidelines

- Flow smoothly from pose to pose, connecting movement with breath
- Each movement should be coordinated with either inhale or exhale
- Include sun salutations and variations as foundation for flow
- Build sequences that move logically from one pose to the next
- For {{difficulty}} level, include appropriate {{difficulty_variations}} transitions
- Ensure adequate warm-up before demanding poses
- Focus on {{focus}} while maintaining whole-body awareness
- Create balanced sequences with appropriate counter-poses
- Include standing, seated, and supine poses for a complete practice
- End with appropriate cooling poses and adequate relaxation

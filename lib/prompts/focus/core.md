# Core Focus Guidelines

Incorporate poses that engage the abdominals, back, and pelvic floor throughout the practice.

- Target multiple layers of core musculature (rectus abdominis, obliques, transverse abdominis)
- Include poses that strengthen the back alongside anterior core
- Incorporate dynamic and static core work
- Focus on both core stability and mobility
- Include twisting poses to target the obliques
- Incorporate poses that strengthen the pelvic floor
- Balance core-intensive poses with appropriate counter-poses
- Include breath work that enhances core awareness
- Ensure proper warm-up before intense core work
- Incorporate functional core movements that translate to daily activities
- Include appropriate modifications for different core strength levels
- Connect core engagement to all other poses in the sequence

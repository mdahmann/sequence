# Flexibility Focus Guidelines

Emphasize longer holds, use props as needed, and sequence logically to safely increase range of motion.

- Begin with dynamic movement to warm tissues before deeper stretches
- Progress from active to passive stretching techniques
- Hold poses longer (45-90 seconds) to affect connective tissue
- Include proper warm-up sequences before deep stretching
- Teach proper breath techniques to facilitate release
- Offer prop variations to make stretches accessible for different bodies
- Target major muscle groups systematically
- Include appropriate counterposes after deep stretches
- Balance flexibility work with stability and strength
- Incorporate PNF (proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation) techniques when appropriate
- Teach the difference between stretch sensation and pain
- Create sequences that progressively open target areas
- Emphasize mindfulness and patience in approaching flexibility

# General Yoga Sequencing Principles

- Always begin with centering/breath awareness
- Warm up the body appropriately before challenging poses
- Progress from simple to complex movements
- Include counterposes after deep stretches or challenging poses
- Cool down gradually toward final relaxation
- Consider the overall arc of the practice (build up, peak, wind down)
- Ensure the sequence is balanced (left/right, front/back, strength/flexibility)
- Match breath to movement in an appropriate way for the style
- Include transitions that flow logically between poses
- Balance effort and ease throughout the practice
- Ensure adequate preparation for peak poses
- Create logical pose groupings within each phase
- Provide appropriate modifications for all levels
- Honor the traditional wisdom of yoga sequencing
- Be mindful of the energetic effects of different pose types 
- Sometimes feel free to repeat poses in the sequence in mini-sequences that build up
- VALIDATE that your sequence fills the entire requested duration

BEFORE SUBMITTING, VERIFY:
1. Count the total duration of all poses in seconds
2. Ensure it matches or slightly exceeds {{duration_seconds}} seconds
3. If the sequence is too short, add more poses or extend pose durations
4. Check that all bilateral poses have both left and right sides included
